# Battleship DTR

## Group Member Names: Caryn Keffer, Genevieve Nuebel

#### Project Expectations:
  * We both expect to submit a project with a passing grade
  * Expect to learn new coding methods related to the project
  * Have clear and honest communication with each other

#### What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
  * Practice and flow with paired projects and other projects for collaboration in the future
  * Hope to productively struggle
  * Better understanding of how to interact with the code I've built with input/output from the command line
  * Better understanding of how objects interact with eachother, especially when they are several objects (OOP)
  * Be able and willing to help each other when we are stuck or need a better understanding

### Goals and expectations:

  * 12/7 - Complete v1 of DTR by 
  * 12/7 - Review iterations and project scope together 
  * 12/10 - Complete Iteration 1 and half of iteration 2
  * 12/11 - Complete iteration 2
  * 12/15 - Complete iteration 3

### Team strengths:

  * Both - Problem solving
  * Genevieve - Breaking down projects into deliverables and tasks
  * Genevieve - Detail oriented
  * Caryn - Organization and planning
  * Caryn - Better at navigating then driving
  * Caryn - Cheerleader

### How to overcome obstacles:
  * Clarify Problem
  * Think Out Loud (rubber ducking)
  * Take Notes
  * Try a Different Method (literally ruby method)
  * Nuke it (delete and start over)
  * Ask for help - no longer than one Pom, if we are struggling for more than one its a good indicator to reach out for help.
  * Communicate with each other if we run into differences with approach about the project, schedule, or communication with another.

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
  * We are meeting every morning and almost every evening
  * If either one of us has an idea throughout the day send a message on slack (anytime of day is ok for both)
  * Exchanged numbers, can communicate via text when needed

### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  * Caryn
    
    * Good at debugging
    * Each method is only doing one thing - design
    * Writing tests for every single method
    * Improve - Interacting from the command line
    
  * Genevieve
    * Pseudo coding
    * Improve - How objects interact with each other when there are many

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

  * As we begin we will approach everything together
  * Follow through on commitments when made

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
  
  * Dont merge your own pull requests
  * Use Tuple to share and code together
  * Google calendar for schedule and touch bases
  * Google doc of the project requirements and specs
  * Research if there is a way to visualize the information for the project (objects interacting)
  * During meetings have time set aside for code review only to merge accordingly

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

  * Be specific, actionable and kind when giving and receiving feedback
