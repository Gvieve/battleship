#### What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
  * Practice and flow with paired projects and other projects for collaboration in the future
  * Hope to productively struggle
  * Better understanding of how to interact with the code I've built with input/output from the command line
  * Better understanding of how objects interact with eachother, especially when they are several objects (OOP)

### How to overcome obstacles:
  * Clarify Problem
  * Think Out Loud (rubber ducking)
  * Take Notes
  * Try a Different Method (literally ruby method)
  * Nuke it (delete and start over)
  * Ask for help - no longer than one Pom, if we are struggling for more than one its a good indicator to reach out for help.
  * Communicate with each other if we run into differences with approach about the project, schedule, or communication with another.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
  * Created shared google calendar to track scheduled project time. 

  * __Monday Dec 7__

     * Read through overview iteration 1, skim 2 & 3
  
  * __Thursday Dec 10__
     * Original Goal - Iterations 1 & half of 2 is complete, then no check in required on Thursday.
     * Actual progress - Completed Iteration 1 and 25% of iteration 2.
  
  * Friday Dec 11
      * __re-DTR from 9:50-10:30__
      * Project time today during class from 1-2:15pm MST
  
  * __Saturday Dec 12__
      * _After Saturday's project time GOAL is to have iteration 2 complete and starting iteration 3_
      * If we meet our goal, schedule stays the same on Sunday. If not, we may need to add more time after 2pm MST/4pm EST.
  
  * Sunday Dec 13
      * Goal is to have as much as we can get through in iteration 3, if we feel like we are not in a good place with i3 then we will add two hours to stop at 4pm MST/6pm EST.
        * Genevieve - hard stop @ 5:00pm MST
  
  * Monday Dec 14
       * _Tentative evening project time if we feel we need it following 6:30 MST/8:30 EST am session_
  
  * Tuesday Dec 15
      * Goal is to be complete with iteration 3 by Tuesday evening session.
         * if we are complete with I3 then we will use this time to refactor
    
  * Dec 16
      * _tentative 7:45-8:45am checkin_
      * __Project time 1-4pm MST__

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
  * We are meeting every morning and almost every evening
  * If either one of us has an idea throughout the day send a message on slack (anytime of day is ok for both)
  * Exchanged numbers, can communicate via text when needed

### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  * Caryn
    
    * Good at debugging
    * Each method is only doing one thing - design
    * Writing tests for every single method
    * Improve - Interacting from the command line
    
  * Genevieve
    * Pseudo coding
    * Improve - How objects interact with each other when there are many

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

  * As we begin we will approach everything together
  * Follow through on commitments when made

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
  
  * Dont merge your own pull requests
  * Use Tuple to share and code together
  * Google calendar for schedule and touch bases
  * Google doc of the project requirements and specs
  * Research if there is a way to visualize the information for the project (objects interacting)
  * During meetings have time set aside for code review only to merge accordingly

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

  * Be specific, actionable and kind when giving and receiving feedback
