# Battleship DTR

## Group Member Names: Caryn Keffer, Genevieve Nuebel

#### Project Expectations:
  * We both expect to submit a project with a passing grade
  * Expect to learn new coding methods related to the project
  * Have clear and honest communication with each other

#### What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
  * Practice and flow with paired projects and other projects for collaboration in the future
  * Hope to productively struggle
  * Better understanding of how to interact with the code I've built with input/output from the command line
  * Better understanding of how objects interact with eachother, especially when they are several objects (OOP)
  * Be able and willing to help each other when we are stuck or need a better understanding

### Goals and expectations:

  * 12/7 - Complete v1 of DTR by 
  * 12/7 - Review iterations and project scope together 
  * 12/10 - Complete Iteration 1 and half of iteration 2
  * 12/11 - Complete iteration 2
  * 12/15 - Complete iteration 3

### Team strengths:

  * Both - Problem solving
  * Genevieve - Breaking down projects into deliverables and tasks
  * Genevieve - Detail oriented
  * Caryn - Organization and planning
  * Caryn - Better at navigating then driving
  * Caryn - Cheerleader

### How to overcome obstacles:
  * Clarify Problem
  * Think Out Loud (rubber ducking)
  * Take Notes
  * Try a Different Method (literally ruby method)
  * Nuke it (delete and start over)
  * Ask for help - no longer than one Pom, if we are struggling for more than one its a good indicator to reach out for help.
  * Communicate with each other if we run into differences with approach about the project, schedule, or communication with another.
